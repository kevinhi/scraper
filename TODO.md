# **Product Scraper Application TODO**

This document lists potential improvements, optimizations, and new features that could be added to the Product Scraper Application to enhance its functionality, user experience, and performance.

---

## **1. Structural and Code Quality Improvements**

- **Code Modularization**: 
   - Break down large functions into smaller, reusable functions.
   - Separate GUI event handlers from logic, moving more logic into helper classes or functions.
   - Introduce a factory design pattern for scraping different websites with specific configurations.

- **Error Handling and Resilience**:
   - Implement a retry mechanism for page loads and element searches if they fail due to timeouts or network issues.
   - Improve exception handling with more specific errors and custom exception classes.
   - Add error logs for missing fields in the configuration file with suggestions for correction.

- **Configuration File Structure**:
   - Split configuration into separate JSON files (e.g., `settings.json`, `user_preferences.json`) for cleaner organization.
   - Add comments or metadata within configuration files explaining each setting’s purpose.

---

## **2. Performance Optimizations**

- **Multithreaded Scraping**:
   - Implement multithreading to scrape multiple pages simultaneously, reducing overall scraping time.
   - Allow configurable thread count based on user’s system performance.

- **Asynchronous GUI Updates**:
   - Use asynchronous tasks to further improve GUI responsiveness during scraping.
   - Offload heavy operations like data processing and saving to separate threads.

- **WebDriver Reuse and Optimization**:
   - Reuse a single WebDriver instance for multiple scraping tasks to avoid repeated initialization time.
   - Implement session management to preserve browser state across scraping runs.

---

## **3. UI/UX Improvements**

- **Responsive Design**:
   - Improve responsiveness of the Tkinter GUI to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
   - Use grid and pack layout managers more effectively to make components scale with window resizing.

- **Enhanced Logging Interface**:
   - Add a search function in the log display area for easier debugging and filtering.
   - Allow users to filter log messages by level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR).
   - Provide an option to export logs for external debugging and support.

- **Real-Time Progress Indicators**:
   - Display the estimated time remaining and a detailed progress percentage for each step of the scraping process.
   - Show a live feed of product titles being scraped to provide immediate feedback to the user.

- **Help and Documentation**:
   - Include an in-GUI help section with tooltips for each field and a FAQ section.
   - Add a “Getting Started” guide for new users, covering configuration and usage basics.

---

## **4. Data Handling and Storage Enhancements**

- **Database Integration**:
   - Use a database (SQLite or MySQL) to store product data instead of CSV for better management of large datasets.
   - Add a historical price tracking table to store product title, price, and timestamp of scraping.

- **Historical Data Collection**:
   - Record and maintain historical prices for each product, with dates and times.
   - Implement a matching algorithm to associate products by title (even if slightly varied) for accurate historical tracking.
   - Add the ability to query historical data and visualize price trends.

- **Data Cleaning and Validation**:
   - Add data validation to filter out products with incomplete or inconsistent information.
   - Implement mechanisms to detect and skip duplicate products based on title, SKU, or unique product ID.

---

## **5. New Functionalities**

- **Product Matching and Tracking**:
   - Match products by title, SKU, or unique attributes to track price changes over time.
   - Add a feature to alert users if a product’s price drops below a specified threshold.

- **Multi-Site Support**:
   - Extend support to scrape from multiple e-commerce websites, using separate configurations for each site.
   - Create a site-specific scraping module with CSS selectors and configurations tailored to each supported website.

- **Price History and Analytics**:
   - Store historical price data for each product and display trends and analytics within the GUI.
   - Allow users to set up automated alerts or notifications when product prices drop.

- **Scheduling and Automation**:
   - Allow users to schedule scraping tasks at specific times or intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - Add an option to run the scraper in headless mode and save data without launching the GUI.

- **Data Export Options**:
   - Support additional export formats like JSON and Excel, with options for filtering and formatting.
   - Provide an option to save data directly to cloud storage services or an external database.

---

## **6. User Preferences and Customization**

- **User-Agent and Proxy Rotation**:
   - Implement automatic user-agent rotation to reduce the risk of being blocked by websites.
   - Add support for proxies and proxy rotation, allowing users to set up multiple proxies to cycle through.

- **Configurable Logging Levels**:
   - Allow users to set the logging level from the GUI (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
   - Add an option to save logs to different files based on level or date.

- **Customizable Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Allow users to set up custom alerts for price changes, new product listings, or specific keywords.
   - Enable email notifications or system alerts when certain conditions are met (e.g., product price falls below threshold).

- **Enhanced Configuration Management**:
   - Save user configurations as profiles, allowing users to quickly switch between different scraping setups.
   - Allow import/export of configuration profiles for sharing or backup purposes.

---

## **7. Security and Compliance**

- **Anti-Bot Detection Measures**:
   - Add random delays, scrolling actions, and mouse movements to mimic human interaction during scraping.
   - Implement CAPTCHA handling or prompt the user if a CAPTCHA challenge is detected.

- **Compliance with Website Terms of Service**:
   - Provide a disclaimer about scraping restrictions and terms of service for each supported website.
   - Include a feature to throttle requests to stay within acceptable usage limits for each site.

---

## **8. Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Unit and Integration Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for each module, focusing on edge cases for data extraction, logging, and configuration management.
   - Add integration tests to validate the interaction between modules, especially during complex scraping tasks.

- **Automated GUI Testing**:
   - Use a GUI testing tool to automate tests on the Tkinter interface, ensuring all buttons and fields function as expected.
   - Test responsiveness and behavior under different configurations and screen sizes.

- **Error Handling Validation**:
   - Test error handling for various scenarios, including network failures, invalid selectors, and configuration issues.
   - Simulate common errors to ensure that the application logs meaningful messages and recovers gracefully.

## **9. Documentation and Developer Guides**

- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Create detailed documentation for developers, including code structure, module purpose, and API usage.
   - Add a contribution guide for open-source collaboration, covering coding standards, branching strategy, and pull request processes.

- **User Manual and Tutorials**:
   - Provide a user manual with step-by-step instructions for setup, configuration, and usage.
   - Include a troubleshooting guide for common issues, like missing WebDriver or configuration errors.

- **In-App Documentation**:
   - Add context-sensitive help directly within the application, with descriptions for each field and feature.
   - Include examples of correct CSS selectors and URLs for easier configuration.

---

## **10. Future Feature Ideas**

- **AI-Assisted Data Extraction**:
   - Use machine learning to automatically detect and adapt to page layout changes, reducing the need for manual selector updates.
   - Implement AI to recognize product details from page images and text if CSS selectors are missing.

- **Data Visualization**:
   - Add a data visualization module to display price trends, product popularity, and other analytics.
   - Integrate with libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to provide charts and graphs for data analysis.

- **Automated Updates**:
   - Implement a system to automatically check for updates and download the latest version.
   - Notify users within the app when a new version is available, including release notes.
